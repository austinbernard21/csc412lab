                    I am a Computer Science student at SF State. I've created some simple applications using Java, C++, and Python so far. I'm interested in data
                    science and machine learning. Another hobby of mine is drumming and music in general and I'm hoping to create an application in the future that
                    implements both of these together.

                    <p>HQ_Trivia Python Script</p>
                    <p class="project-desc">This is a python script that runs Optical Character 
                        Recognition on the popular live trivia game HQ to 
                        search for most probable answer before the timer runs out.
                        By screen-mirroring a phone with the live game running, I was able to grab the image of the question and answer interface and
                        convert the image to computer readable text using the Tesseract OCR engine.
                        After splitting the question and answers, the script performs a google search and performs a simple probability algorithm to find the most
                        likely answer out of the choices.
                        Code is on <a href="https://github.com/austinbernard21/HQ_SCRIPT">my GitHub.</a>

                    <p class="project-desc">One of the first songs my band and I made back in 2015. The song is called "Honesty". Our lead singer wrote this
                        about his ex-girlfriend because she really sucks and we all hated her. Real good song. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/3rd-army/honesty">Check it out.</a>
